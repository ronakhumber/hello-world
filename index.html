         <p>I am a software developer based out of New Delhi, India. I have worked on various small projects during my university and have more interest towards web development. A little about my background is below.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I went to a high school, post which I did undergraduate studies in CS.</p>
        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>I completed my school at Sachdeva Public School with a whopping 97%. It was a school just besides my home, so I usually walked to my school daily.</p>
        <h3>University</h3>
        <p>
        I got into one of the best university in my state, and completed by Bachelors of technology in CS. I graduated with 8.6 CGPA in 2020 and started working post that.</p>
        <h2> Work </h2>
        <p>I currently work as a backend developer(Java) in a reputed firm in India. I wish to take on a full stack developer job in the future for which this course will help me.</p>
